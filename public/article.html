        <h2 class="self-start font-bold text-xl">Types of guitars</h2>

        <p class="-mt-4">
            There are three main types of guitars: acoustic, electric, and classical.
        </p>

        <h2 class="self-start font-bold text-xl">Acoustic guitars</h2>

        <p class="-mt-4">
            Acoustic guitars are the most common type of guitar. They are typically made of wood and produce sound through the vibration of their strings, which are amplified by the body of the guitar. Acoustic guitars are a great choice for beginners and experienced players alike.
        </p>

        <h2 class="self-start font-bold text-xl">Electric guitars</h2>

        <p class="-mt-4">
            Electric guitars are powered by electricity and produce sound through pickups and an amplifier. Electric guitars are perfect for genres like rock, blues, and metal, and can be used in both live and studio settings.
        </p>

        <h2 class="self-start font-bold text-xl">Classical guitars</h2>

        <p class="-mt-4">
            Classical guitars are designed for playing classical music. They have nylon strings, a wider neck, and a smaller body than acoustic or electric guitars. Classical guitars are often used to play classical, folk, and flamenco music.
        </p>

        <h2 class="self-start font-bold text-xl">Guitar Body Shapes</h2>

        <p class="-mt-4">
            When choosing a guitar, you should consider the body shape. Different body shapes produce different sounds, so it's important to find the one that best suits your needs.

            The most common body shapes are dreadnought, jumbo, and parlor. Dreadnought guitars are the most popular acoustic body shape. They have a wide body and produce a deep, rich sound. Jumbo guitars have an even bigger body and produce a loud, powerful sound, while parlor guitars have a smaller body and produce a mellow, sweet sound.
        </p>
